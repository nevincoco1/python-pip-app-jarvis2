JARVIS v2
=========

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/mpolden/jarvis2.png)](https://travis-ci.org/mpolden/jarvis2)

JARVIS is a dashboard framework designed to run on the Raspberry Pi.

It features live-updating widgets using
[server-sent events](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server-sent_events) and can be
easily extended to fit your needs.

Dependencies
------------
JARVIS requires Python 2.7+ or Python 3.3+ to run.

Some dependencies have native bindings which requires these packages on
Debian/Ubuntu:

    aptitude install -y python-dev libxml2-dev libxslt1-dev zlib1g-dev

Install requirements:

    pip install -r requirements.txt

For development it's recommended to use [virtualenv](http://www.virtualenv.org).

Configuration
-------------
All configuration of widgets is done in a single Python source file. The
configuration is specified by setting the `JARVIS_SETTINGS` environment
variable.

A sample config (`app/config.py.sample`) is provided. This file can be used as a
starting point for your own configuration.

Copy `app/config.py.sample` to `app/config.py` and edit it to suit your needs.

Usage
-----
After installing dependencies and creating a config file, the app can be started
by running:

    JARVIS_SETTINGS=config.py make run

To start the app in debug mode, use:

    JARVIS_SETTINGS=config.py make debug

Run a job standalone and pretty-print output (useful for debugging):

    JARVIS_SETTINGS=config.py make run-job

Create Google API credentials (required for calendar and gmail widget):

    JARVIS_SETTINGS=config.py make google-api-auth

Create a new widget:

    make widget

Create a new dashboard:

    make dashboard

Widgets
-------
See [WIDGETS.md](docs/WIDGETS.md) for documentation on available widgets.

Deployment

Development environment
-----------------------
A `Vagrantfile` is included for use with [Vagrant](http://www.vagrantup.com).
Version `1.8+` is required for the `ansible_local` provisioner to work.

Run `vagrant up` in the repository root to provision a development environment.
